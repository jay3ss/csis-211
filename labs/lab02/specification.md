# Specification for the Set Class

## Problem

A set is a special bag that does not allow duplicates in which order doesn't
matter. Mathematically, a set is an unordered collection of distinct objects,
considered as an object in its own right ([1], [2]).

## Attributes

A set has the following mathematical attributes:

- Holds unordered objects
- Holds an arbitrary number oj objects
- No duplicated objects
- 

## Operations

A set has the following operations:

- Check if it's empty
- Check for equality between two sets
- Check if an element is in a set
- Check if a set is a subset of another set
- Check if two sets are disjoint
- Cartesian product
- Union
- Intersection
- Difference between sets
- Cardinality (size?)


## From Chapter 1 Programming Problem 5

A set is a special bag that does not allow duplicates. Specify each operation
for a set of objects by stating its purpose, by describing its parameters, and
by writing preconditions, postconditions, and a pseudocode version of its
header. Then write a C++ interface for the set. Include javadoc -style comments
in your code.
